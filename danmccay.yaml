      Dragonase's goal is to increase human lifespan through cell replacement therapy. In particular, Dragonase is working on anti-aging hematopoietic stem cell replacement therapy. Other areas of interest include other types of cell replacement, drugs with the potential to expand and/or rejuvenate stem cells, and basic mechanisms of aging. By rejuvenating stem cells in bone marrow, it should be possible to achieve systemic rejuvenation, given the myriad effects of the immune system on most tissues of the human body. Dragonase intends to revolutionize hematopoietic stem cell replcaement therapy by creating the new state-of-the-art in HSC growth and expansion in order to facilitate immunoablation-free cell infusion. Consequently, Dragonase is deeply interested in cell culture media design. Dragonase is developing a self-driving cell biologist, using robotics and AI, to facilitate their work in cell culture media design.

      I need you to answer several Questions. Divide your response into section, with one section for each Question, and give each section a header such as [[SECTION 1]], [[SECTION 2]], and so on.
      
      Question 1: Based on what I've told you, how relevant is this scientific abstract to Dragonase's long-term, broad goals? Please respond with a score on a 0-9 scale, with 0 being completely irrelevant and 9 being extremely relevant. Format your response like "<<lt-relevance: 5>>". 
      
      Question 2: Based on what I've told you, how relevant is this scientific abstract to Dragonase's medium-term goal of making an anti-aging hematopoietic stem cell replacement therapy? Please respond with a score on a 0-9 scale, with 0 being completely irrelevant and 9 being extremely relevant. Format your response like "<<mt-relevance: 5>>". 

      Question 3: Based on what I've told you, how relevant is this scientific abstract to Dragonase's short-term goal of expanding human hematopoietic stem cells cultured in vitro? Please respond with a score on a 0-9 scale, with 0 being completely irrelevant and 9 being extremely relevant. Format your response like "<<st-relevance: 5>>". 

      Question 4: Provide a short paragraph that describes your reasoning to your answers to Questions 1 through 3.
      
      Question 5: What might be the most exciting, interesting, and/or novel finding in this paper, with regards to Dragonase's goals?
      
      Question 6: What might be the biggest specific shortcoming of this paper, with regards to Dragonase's goals?
      
      Question 7: What additional information might help contextualize and/or evaluate this paper?

      Dragonase's goal is to increase human lifespan through cell replacement therapy. In particular, Dragonase is working on anti-aging hematopoietic stem cell replacement therapy. Other areas of interest include other types of cell replacement, drugs with the potential to expand and/or rejuvenate stem cells, and basic mechanisms of aging. By rejuvenating stem cells in bone marrow, it should be possible to achieve systemic rejuvenation, given the myriad effects of the immune system on most tissues of the human body. Dragonase intends to revolutionize hematopoietic stem cell replcaement therapy by creating the new state-of-the-art in HSC growth and expansion in order to facilitate immunoablation-free cell infusion. Consequently, Dragonase is deeply interested in cell culture media design. Dragonase is developing a self-driving cell biologist, using robotics and AI, to facilitate their work in cell culture media design.

      Dragonase's current capabilities are as follows. Dragonase can do cell culture experiments. Dragonase has access to both bone marrow-derived and peripheral human hematopoietic stem cells. Dragonase uses a moderately hypoxic mammalian cell culture incubator that operates at 5% CO2 and 8% O2. Dragonase has an inverted live-cell microscope capable of brightfield and fluorescence imaging at 10x and 40x magnification. Dragonase can do longitudinal and high-throughput imaging with its microscope. Dragonase does cell culture experiments for exactly 14 days. Dragonase can do immunofluorescence. Dragonase can freely change the composition of culture media at the start of an experiment but not during an experiment. Dragonase can do simple surface modification for cell culture, such as collagen or fibronectin coating. Dragonase can buy antibodies, small molecules, kits, therapeutics, and other materials at-will. 

      Dragonase's current best practice is to culture HSCs in albumin-free IMDM with pen/strep, ITSE (insulin+transferrin+selenium+ethanolamine), Kolliphor 188, 740Y-P, butyzamide, and UM171. HSCs are typically cultured in collagen-coated glass-bottom well-plates. However, Dragonase is open to exploring alternatives (such as StemSpan-based media or fibronectin coatings).

      Dragonase cannot do colony-forming assays, PCR, viral transduction, or flow cytometry.

      Next, I'm going to provide the full-text of a scientific article:

      I need you to design an experiment that builds off this paper, tests this paper, or is inspired by this paper. The experiment must advance Dragonase's goals and be within Dragonase's capabilities. Make sure to include all relevant positive and negative controls and specify the appropriate concentrations of any substances being tested, if applicable.

      Provide your experiment, in the form of prose no more than one paragraph long, below. After you write your experiment, write a second paragraph to explain the connection between this paper and your experiment.
    schematizer_preamble: |
      Your task is to convert a prose description of an experiment into a SQL-based description of an experiment, by providing a series of SQL commands. The prose will describe an experiment that involves one-or-more culture conditions for hematopoietic stem cells. Each row in the "trialsv2db" SQL table describes a single culture condition, and an experiment is defined by one-or-more rows. You are allowed two types of SQL commands: either adding rows via "INSERT INTO trialsv2db" commands or adding columns via "ALTER trialsv2db ADD COLUMN" commands. Every experimental condition should be unique - i.e., do not replicate conditions. Respond only with these types of SQL commands. Type nothing else.

      Here is the SQL table schema:
